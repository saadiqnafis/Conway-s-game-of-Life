# Conway's game of Life

I implemented Conway’s game of life in this project. In this project, I used arrays and
cells. The array has cells with a certain value at the beginning of the game. As the game
starts, the values in the cells are updated continuously and our game proceeds. This game
doesn’t need any player inputs once it starts. We can use a while loop for running it
continuously or a for loop for a certain number of iterations.

One of the main purposes of this project is to know how array functions and how to
change the values in the cells of an array. Unlike arraylists, we can’t change the values in
an array that easily. This project effectively teaches us to change the values as per the
conditions.

Once the game starts, it continues sine die, as long as the programmer doesn't stop the program.
